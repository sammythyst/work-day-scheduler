## Description
The purpose of this project is to allow users to plan and schedule their day and to visibly see where they're at in their itinerary. Tasks are entered by the user in one of the hour-long slots available to them. 

## Usage
As users want to plan their day, they will be able to input different tasks into an allotted text field associated with the time they want to complete the task. To save the task, click the save button next to the text field and your task will be saved locally to your device. The task will remain there as long as it is saved to the device. The gray timeslots represent time in the day that has already passed, the red indicates the current hour, and the green represents the hours in the day yet to come.
